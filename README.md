# checkbox_detection

I interviewed with a company that was trying to process paperwork as pngs. They were using Google Vision API, but it was rather expensive to use the checkbox detection API so they were trying to make their own software. This folder contains initial analysis of how I would go about creating my own checkbox detection software.
